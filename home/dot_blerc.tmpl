# If ble/contrib/integration/fzf cannot find the fzf directory, please set the
# following variable "_ble_contrib_fzf_base" manually.  The value
# "/path/to/fzf-directory" should be replaced by a path to the fzf directory
# such as "$HOME/.fzf" or "/usr/share/fzf" that contain
# "shell/{completion,key-bindings}.bash" or "{completion,key-bindings}.bash".

# Note: If you want to combine fzf-completion with bash_completion, you need to
# load bash_completion earlier than fzf-completion.  This is required
# regardless of whether to use ble.sh or not.
